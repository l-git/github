- Blocking I/O
means that the calling system does not return control to the caller
until the operation is finished. As a result, the caller is blocked and
cannot perform other activities during that time.
- Non-blocking Synchronous I/O
means that call returns control to the caller immediately and the
caller is not made to wait. The invoked system immediately returns one
of two responses: If the call was executed and the results are ready,
then the caller is told of that. Alternatively, the invoked system can
tell the caller that the system has no resources (no data in the
socket) to perform the requested action.
- Non-blocking Asynchronous I/O
means that the calling function returns control to the caller
immediately, reporting that the requested action was started. The
invoked system will notify the caller (by callback for example), when
the result is ready for processing.
